# lego-train-automation

Small project to automate my 9V Lego toy train. Currently thes train is
controlled by +/-9V current with a haptic controller.

General idea is:

* Replace haptic controller with software interface:
  * LM982
  * Raspberry Pi
  * REST API
* Implement simple iOS app to control train via an old iPad mini
